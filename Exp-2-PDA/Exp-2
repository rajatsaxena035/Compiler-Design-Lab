Objective: WAP to implement Push Down Automata.

Theory:
1. A pushdown automaton (PDA) is a type of automaton that employs a stack.
2. Pushdown automata are used in theories about what can be computed by machines. 
3. They are more capable than finite-state machines but less capable than Turing machines.
4. Deterministic pushdown automata can recognize all deterministic context-free languages while nondeterministic ones can recognize all context-free languages.
5. Deterministic pushdown automata is used in parser design.

Formal Definition:

A PDA is formally defined as a 7-tuple:

M = ( Q ,   Σ ,   Γ ,   δ ,   q 0 ,   Z ,   F ) where

    Q is a finite set of states
    Σ is a finite set which is called the input alphabet
    Γ is a finite set which is called the stack alphabet
    δ is a finite subset of Q × ( Σ ∪ { ε } ) × Γ × Q × Γ* , the transition relation.
    q0 ∈ Q , is the start state
    Z ∈ Γ , is the initial stack symbol
    F ⊆ Q , is the set of accepting states
